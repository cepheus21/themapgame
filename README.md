# themapgame
A software based version of a game some nerds play. Players control planets and create buildings on them, which supplement and fuel the player's economy. The player uses the economy to create ships and form the military backbone of their empire. Players interact with each other and various AI/NPC empires across the map, as the geopolitical borders are the main fuel of tension and conflict between the nations.
